NAME
    Kwiki::DNSBL - Blocks edit from ip addresses in DNS Blackhole lists

DESCRIPTION
    Much of the current WikiSpam comes from open proxies. This plugin
    queries a number of DNS blackhole lists to check if users are using an
    open proxy and blocks them if they do.

    It uses Net::DNSBLLookup which also queries blackhole lists that report
    if an ip address is known to have an open e-mail relay. This plugin
    blocks these users anyway, even though WikiSpam has nothing to do with
    normal e-mail spam.
